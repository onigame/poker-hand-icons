Icons used for language-neutral representation of poker hands

Here are some icons used to represent the different types of poker hands. The icons are intended to be mostly language-neutral (I don't know of any countries that use letters other than "A" for the highest-ranking card in poker).

The files are in Adobe CS6 Illustrator-native EPS files and 300-dpi PNG files.

A description of poker hands can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands

Some hands have different descriptions when their names in other languages are translated back to English.  I know of the following:
 * Four of a Kind = Poker = Quad
 * Flush = Color
 * Straight = Sequence
 * Three of a Kind = Trio = Drill
 * Two Pair = Double Pair = Double Couple
 * Pair = One Pair = Couple
